\section{What is Easybuild?}

EasyBuild is the software build and installation framework that was created by the HPC-UGent
team, and has recently been picked up by HPC sites around the world. It allows you to manage
(scientific) software on High Performance Computing (HPC) systems in an efficient way.

\section{When should I use Easybuild?}

You can use Easybuild to install software in your own VSC account, rather than
requesting a central installation by the HPC support team.

For general software installation requests, please see \autoref{sec:software-installation}. However,
there might be reasons to install the software yourself:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item applying custom patches to the software that only you or your group are using
    \item evaluating new software versions prior to requesting a central software installation
    \item installing (very) old software versions that are no longer eligible for central installation (on new systems)
\end{enumerate}
