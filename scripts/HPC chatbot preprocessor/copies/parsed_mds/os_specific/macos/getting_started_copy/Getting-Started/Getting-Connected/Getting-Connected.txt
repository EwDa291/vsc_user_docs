it should be easy to make use of the `ssh` command in a terminal, but the web portal will work too. 
The web portal[1] offers a convenient way to upload files and gain shell access to the HPC-UGent infrastructure from a standard web browser (no software installation or configuration required).

See shell access[2] when using the web portal, or
connection to the HPC-UGent infrastructure[3] when using a terminal.

Make sure you can get to a shell access to the HPC-UGent infrastructure before proceeding with the next steps.
