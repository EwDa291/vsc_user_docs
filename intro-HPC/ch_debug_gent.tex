\chapter{HPC-UGent debug cluster}
\label{ch:debug_ugent}


\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:debug_ugent_pupose}
The purpose of the debug cluster is to run debug jobs. Additionally, it can be also used for courses. 
The debug cluster is overcommited, which means that 6 times more CPU cores can be
scheduled than physically exist in the cluster. The cluster performance heavily depends on the
workload, and jobs can slow down or speed up during their run. In the case of a
fully loaded cluster, jobs would run about 6 times slower compared to an empty cluster. 
\\ Due to the restrictions (see section~\ref{subsec:debug_ugent_restrictions}) and sharing the CPU
resources, jobs on slaking should normally start more or less immediately. As a consequence,
typical workloads for this cluster should be limited to:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Debugging programs
  \item  Try/debug submit scripts
  \item  Run small jobs for which performance is not an issue (courses, hands-ons, etc.)
  \item  Run interactive jobs (see chapter~\ref{ch:running-interactive-jobs}) with lots of idle time
         (courses, hands-ons, etc.) 
  \item  Run Cluster Desktops (see chapter~\ref{ch:web_portal}) with lots of idle time
         (courses, hands-ons, etc.)
\end{itemize} 

\section{Submitting jobs}
\label{sec:debug_ugent_jobs}

To submit jobs to the HPC-UGent debug cluster nicknamed \lstinline|slaking|, first use:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{module swap cluster/slaking}
\end{prompt}

Then use the familiar \lstinline|qsub|, \lstinline|qstat|, etc. commands.

\subsection{Restrictions}
\label{subsec:debug_ugent_restrictions}

Currently each user may have at most 5 jobs in the queue (iboth running and waiting to run)
and at most 3 jobs per user can be running at the same time. The running jobs may allocate 
no more than 8 CPU cores in total. \\ Please note that based on the (historical) workload
of the debug cluster, the above restrictions and the overcommitment ratio might change
without prior notice.
