\chapter{Running interactive jobs}

\section{Introduction}

Interactive jobs are jobs, which give you an interactive session on one of the compute nodes. Importantly, accessing the compute nodes this way means that the job control system guarantees the resources that you have asked for.

Interactive PBS jobs are similar to non-interactive PBS jobs in that they are submitted to PBS via the command \textbf{qsub}. Where an interactive job differs is that it does not require a job script, the required PBS directives can be specified on the command line.

The syntax for \textit{qsub} for submitting an interactive PBS job is:
\textbf{qsub -I \ldots pbs directives \ldots}

\section{Interactive jobs, without X support}

\textit{\underbar{Tip}: Find the code in ``\~/examples/Chapter05\_Interactive''}

\textit{}

First of all, in order to know on which computer you're working, enter:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{hostname -f }%
ln01.turing.antwerpen.vsc
\end{prompt}

This means that you're now working on the login-node ``\textit{ln01}'' of the UA-HPC-cluster.

The most basic way to start an interactive job is the following:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{qsub -I}%
qsub: waiting for job 432918.master1.turing.antwerpen.vsc to start
qsub: job 432918.master1.turing.antwerpen.vsc ready
$
\end{prompt}

There are two things of note here.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  The ``\textit{qsub''} command (with the interactive -I flag) waits until a node is assigned to your interactive session, connects to the compute node and shows you the terminal prompt on that node.
\item  You'll see that your directory structure of your home directory has remained the same. Your home directory is actually located on a shared storage system.
\end{enumerate}

In order to know on which compute-node you're working, enter again:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{hostname -f}%
r1e3cn18.turing.antwerpen.vsc
\end{prompt}

Note that we are now working on the compute-node called ``\textit{r1e3cn18}''. This is the compute node, which was assigned to us by the scheduler after issuing the ``\textit{qsub -I''} command.

This computer name looks strange, but bears some logic in it.  It provides the system administrators with information where to find the computer in the computer room.

The computer ``r1e3cn18'' stands for:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  ``r1'' is rack \# 1.
\item  ``e3'' is enclosure \#3.
\item  ``cn18'' is compute node \#18.
\end{enumerate}

With this naming convention, the system administrator can easily find the physical computers when they need to execute some maintenance activities.

Now, go to the directory of our second interactive example and run the program ``primes.py''. This program will ask you for an upper limit ($>$ 1) and will print all the primes between 1 and your upper limit:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{cd \~/examples/Chapter05\_Interactive}%
$ %\textbf{./primes.py}%
This program calculates all primes between 1 and your upper limit.
Enter your upper limit ($>$1):   \textbf{50 }
Start Time:  2013-09-11 15:49:06
[Prime\#1] = 1
[Prime\#2] = 2
[Prime\#3] = 3
[Prime\#4] = 5
[Prime\#5] = 7
[Prime\#6] = 11
[Prime\#7] = 13
[Prime\#8] = 17
[Prime\#9] = 19
[Prime\#10] = 23
[Prime\#11] = 29
[Prime\#12] = 31
[Prime\#13] = 37
[Prime\#14] = 41
[Prime\#15] = 43
[Prime\#16] = 47
End Time:  2013-09-11 15:49:06
Duration:  0 seconds.
\end{prompt}

You can exit the Interactive session with:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{exit}%
\end{prompt}

Note that you can now use this allocated node for 1 hour.  After this hour you will be automatically disconnected. You can change this ``usage time'' by explicitly specifying a ``walltime'' , i.e. the time that you want to work on this node.  (Think of walltime as the time elapsed when watching the clock on the wall.

You can work for 3 hours by:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{qsub --I --l walltime=03:00:00}%
\end{prompt}

If the walltime of the job is exceeded, the (Interactive) job will be killed and your connection to the compute node will be closed. So do make sure to provide adequate walltime and that you save your data before your (wall)time is up (exceeded)!  When you do not specify a walltime, you get a default walltime of 1 hour.

\section{Interactive jobs, with X support}

\subsection{Software Installation}

\#IFDEF MAC

To display graphical applications from a Linux computer (such as the VSC clusters) on your OS X machine, you need to install an X Window server.

The X Window system (commonly known as \textbf{X11}, based on its current major version being 11, or shortened to simply \textbf{X}, and sometimes informally \textbf{X-Windows}) is the system-level software infrastructure for the windowing GUI on Linux, BSD and other UNIX-like operating systems. It was designed to handle both local displays, as well as displays sent across a network. More formally, it is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and rich input device capability for networked computers.

Download the latest version of the XQuartz package on:
http://xquartz.macosforge.org/landing/
and install the XQuartz.pkg package.

\includegraphics*[width=5.79in, height=4.12in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0512}

The installer will take you through the installation procedure, just continue clicking $<$continue$>$ on the various screens that will pop-up until your installation was succesfull.

\subsection{Software Installation}

To display graphical applications from a Linux computer (such as the VSC clusters) on your Windows desktop, you need to install an X Window server.

The X Window system (commonly known as \textbf{X11}, based on its current major version being 11, or shortened to simply \textbf{X}, and sometimes informally \textbf{X-Windows}) is the system-level software infrastructure for the windowing GUI on Linux, BSD and other UNIX-like operating systems. It was designed to handle both local displays, as well as displays sent across a network. More formally, it is a computer software system and network protocol that provides a basis for graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and rich input device capability for networked computers.

\paragraph{ Install XMing}

The first task is to install the Xming software.

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Download the Xming installer from the following address:http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/ .  Either download Xming from the \textbf{Public Domain Releases} (free) or from the \textbf{Website Releases} (after a donation) on the website.
\item  Run the Xming setup program on your Windows desktop.
\item  Keep the proposed default folders for the Xming installation.
\item  When selecting the components that need to be installed, make sure to select '\textit{XLaunch wizard}' and '\textit{Normal PuTTY Link SSH client}'.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics*[width=4.27in, height=3.32in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0500}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  We suggest to create a Desktop icon for Xming and XLaunch.
\item  And $<$\textit{Install}$>$.
\end{enumerate}

And now we can run Xming:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  \includegraphics*[width=0.32in, height=0.32in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0501}  Select XLaunch from the Start Menu or by double-clicking the Desktop icon.
\item  Select $<$\textit{Multiple Windows}$>$. This will open each application in a separate window.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics*[width=4.60in, height=3.57in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0502}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Select $<$\textit{Start no client}$>$ to make XLaunch wait for other programs (such as PuTTY).\includegraphics*[width=4.01in, height=3.11in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0503}
\end{enumerate}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Select $<$\textit{Clipboard}$>$ to share the clipboard.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics*[width=3.90in, height=3.03in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0503}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Finally $<$\textit{Save configuration}$>$ into a file. You can keep the default filename and save it in your Xming installation directory.
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics*[width=3.90in, height=3.03in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0504}

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Now Xming is running in the background \ldots and you can launch a graphical application in your PuTTY terminal.
\item  Open a PuTTY terminal and connect  to the HPC.
\item  In order to test the X-server, run ``\textit{xclock}''. ``\textit{xclock}'' is the standard GUI clock for the X Window System.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{xclock}%
\end{prompt}

You should see the XWindow clock application appearing on your Windows machine. The ``\textit{xclock}'' application runs on the login-node of the HPC, but is displayed on your Windows machine.

\includegraphics*[width=1.44in, height=1.62in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0505}

\paragraph{ SSH Tunnel}

In order to work in client/server mode, it is often required to establish an SSH tunnel between your Windows desktop machine and the compute node your job is running on.  PuTTY must have been installed on your computer, and you should be able to connect via SSH to the HPC cluster's login node.

Because of one or more firewalls between your desktop and the HPC clusters, it is generally impossible to communicate directly with a process on the cluster from your desktop except when the network managers have given you explicit permission (which for security reasons is not often done). One way to work around this limitation is SSH tunneling.

There are several cases where this is useful:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Running X applications on the cluster: The X program cannot directly communicate with the X server on your local system. In this case, the tunneling is easy to set up as PuTTY will do it for you if you select the right options on the X11 settings page as explained on the page about text-mode access using PuTTY.
\item  Running a server application on the cluster that a client on the desktop connects to. One example of this scenario is ParaView in remote visualization mode, with the interactive client on the desktop and the data processing and image rendering on the cluster. This scenario is explained on this page.
\item  Running clients on the cluster and a server on your desktop. In this case, the source port is a port on the cluster and the destination port is on the desktop.
\end{enumerate}

Procedure: A tunnel from a local client to a specific computer node on the cluster

\begin{enumerate}
\item  Log in on the login node via PuTTY.
\item  Start the server job, note the compute node's name the job is running on (e.g., 'r1i3n5'), as well as the port the server is listening on (e.g., '44444').
\item  Set up the tunnel:

\begin{enumerate}
\item  In the ``\textit{Category}'' pane, expand $<$\textit{Connection}$>$$<$\textit{SSH}$>$, and select $<$\textit{Tunnels}$>$ as show below:
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\includegraphics*[width=4.85in, height=4.67in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0506}

\begin{enumerate}
\item \begin{enumerate}
\item  In the ``\textit{Source port}'' field, enter the local port to use (e.g., \textit{11111}).
\item  In the ``\textit{Destination}'' field, enter \textit{$<$hostname$>$:$<$server-port$>$} (e.g., r1i3n5:44444 as in the example above).
\item  Click the $<$\textit{Add}$>$ button.
\item  Click the $<$\textit{Open}$>$ button
\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

The tunnel is now ready to use.

\subsection{Connect with X-forwarding }

In order to get the graphical output of your application (which is running on a compute node on the UA-HPC) transferred to your personal screen, you will need to re-connect to the UA-HPC with X-forwarding enabled, which is done with the ``-X'' option.

First exit and re-connect to the UA-HPC with X-forwarding enabled:

\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{exit}%
$ %\textbf{ssh --X $<$vsc-account$>$@login.turing.calcua.ua.ac.be}%
$ %\textbf{hostname -f}%
ln01.turing.antwerpen.vsc
\end{prompt}

We first check whether our GUI's on the login node are decently forwarded to your screen on your local machine. An easy way to test it is by running a small X-application on the login node. Type:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{xclock}%
\end{prompt}

And you should see a clock appearing on your screen.

\includegraphics*[width=2.47in, height=2.78in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0507}

You can close your clock and connect further to a compute node with again your X-forwarding enabled:

\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{qsub --I -X}%
qsub: waiting for job 432918.master1.turing.antwerpen.vsc to start
qsub: job 432918.master1.turing.antwerpen.vsc ready
$ %\textbf{hostname -f}%
r1e2cn09.turing.antwerpen.vsc
$ %\textbf{xclock}%
\end{prompt}

and you should see your clock again.

\subsection{Run simple example}

We have developed a little interactive program that shows the communication in 2 directions. It will send information to your local screen, but also asks you to click a button.

Now run the message program:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{./message}%
\end{prompt}

You should see the following message appearing.

\includegraphics*[width=3.51in, height=1.47in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0508}

Click any button and see what happens.

\begin{prompt}
  -----------------------

  $<$ Enjoy the day! Mooh $>$

  -----------------------

           \textbackslash    \^{}\_\_\^{}

           \textbackslash   (oo)\textbackslash \_\_\_\_\_\_\_

              (\_\_)\textbackslash        )\textbackslash /\textbackslash

                   \textbar \textbar ----w \textbar

                   \textbar \textbar      \textbar \textbar

$
\end{prompt}

\subsection{Run your interactive application}

In this last example, we will show you that you can just work on this compute node, just as if you were working locally on your desktop.  We will run the Fibonacci example of the previous Chapter again, but now in full Interactive mode. Remember that it was written in MATLAB, so we first load the MATLAB modules.
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{module load MATLAB}%
\end{prompt}

And start the MATLAB interactive environment:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{matlab}%
\end{prompt}

And start the fibo2.m program in the command window:
\begin{prompt}
$f$x $>$$>$ %\textbf{run fibo2.m}%
\end{prompt}

\includegraphics*[width=5.84in, height=4.11in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0509}

And see the displayed calculations, \dots

\includegraphics*[width=5.84in, height=4.11in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0510}

as well as the nice ``plot'' appearing:

\includegraphics*[width=5.76in, height=2.94in, keepaspectratio=false]{img0511}

You can work in this MATLAB GUI, and finally terminate the application by entering ``\textbf{exit}'' in the command window again.
\begin{prompt}
$f$x $>$$>$ %\textbf{exit}%
\end{prompt}
