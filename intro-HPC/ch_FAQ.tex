\section{When will my job start?}

The clusters use a fair-share sheduling policy. There is no guarantee on when a
job will start, since it depends on a number of factors. One of these factors is
the priority of the job, which is determined by
\begin{itemize}
    \item historical use: the aim is to balance usage over users, so
        infrequent users get a highter priority

    \item requested resources (amount of cores, walltime, memory, ...): the larger
        the resource request is, the lower the priority will be

    \item time waiting in queue: queued jobs get a higher priority over time

    \item user limits: this avoids having a single user hog the entire cluster

\end{itemize}
