The HPC-UGent web portal[1] provides a file browser that allows uploading files.
For more information see the file browser section[2].

Upload both files (`run.sh` and `tensorflow-mnist.py`) to your **home directory** and go back to your shell.

!!! Info

    As an alternative, you can use WinSCP (see our section[3])
