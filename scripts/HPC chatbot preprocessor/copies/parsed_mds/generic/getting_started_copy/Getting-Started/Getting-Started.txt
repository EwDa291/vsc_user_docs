Welcome to the "Getting Started" guide. This chapter will lead you through the initial steps of logging into the HPC-UGent infrastructure and submitting your very first job. We'll also walk you through the process step by step using a practical example.

In addition to this chapter, you might find the recording of the *Introduction to HPC-UGent* training session[1] to be a useful resource.

Before proceeding, read the introduction to HPC[2] to gain an understanding of the HPC-UGent infrastructure and related terminology.
