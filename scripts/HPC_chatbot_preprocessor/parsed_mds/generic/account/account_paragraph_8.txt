Applying for the account
Visit <https://account.vscentrum.be/>
You will be redirected to our WAYF (Where Are You From) service where
you have to select your "Home Organisation".
Select "UGent" in the dropdown box and optionally select "Save my preference"
and "permanently".
Click "Confirm"
You will now be taken to the authentication page of your institute.
After you log in using your UGent login and password, you will be asked to
upload the file that contains your public key, i.e., the file
"id_rsa.pub" which you have generated earlier. Make sure that your
public key is actually accepted for upload, because if it is in a wrong
format, wrong type or too short, then it will be refused.
