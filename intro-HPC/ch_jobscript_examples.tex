\section{Single-core job}

Here's an example of a single-core job script:

\examplecode{bash}{single_core.sh}

\section{Multi-core job}

Here's an example of a multi-core job script that uses \lstinline|mympirun|:

\examplecode{bash}{multi_core.sh}

\section{Running a command with a maximum time limit}
\label{sec:maximum-timelimit-timeout-jobscript}

If we want to run a job, but we're not sure it will finish before the job runs
out of walltime and we want to copy data back before, we have to stop the main
command before the walltime runs out and copy the data back.

This can be done with the \lstinline|timeout| command. This command sets a limit
of time a program can run for, and when this limit is exceeded, it kills the program.
Here's an example job script using \lstinline|timeout|:

\examplecode{bash}{timeout.sh}

For the curious, here is the program used:

\examplecode{bash}{example_program.sh}
