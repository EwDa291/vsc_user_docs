You can download PuTTY from the official address:
<https://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/latest.html>. You
probably want the 64-bits version. If you can install software on your
computer, you can use the "Package files", if not, you can download and
use putty.exe and puttygen.exe in the "Alternative binary files"
section.
The PuTTY package consists of several components, but we'll only use
two:
1. PuTTY: the Telnet and SSH client itself (to login, see Open a terminal)
2.  PuTTYgen: an RSA and DSA key generation utility (to generate a key pair,
    see Generate a public/private key pair)
Generating a public/private key pair
