\chapter{Useful Linux commands}

\section{Basic Linux Usage}

All the UA-HPC clusters run the ``Scientific Linux'' operating system:

This means that, when you connect to one of them, you get a command line interface, which looks something like this:
\begin{prompt}
vsc20167@ln01: \$
\end{prompt}

When you see this, we also say you are inside a "shell". The shell will accept your commands, and execute them.

\begin{tabular}{|p{0.3in}|p{2.5in}|} \hline
ls & Shows you a list of files in the current directory \\ \hline
cd & Change current working directory \\ \hline
rm & Remove file or directory \\ \hline
joe & Text editor \\ \hline
echo & Prints its parameters to the screen \\ \hline
\end{tabular}

Most commands will accept or even need parameters, which are placed after the command, separated by spaces. A simple example with the 'echo' command:

\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{echo This is a test}%
This is a test
\end{prompt}

Important here is the "\$" sign in front of the first line. This should not be typed, but is a convention meaning "the rest of this line should be typed at your shell prompt". The lines not starting with the "\$" sign are usually the feedback or output from the command.

More commands will be used in the rest of this text, and will be explained then if necessary. If not, you can usually get more information about a command, say the item or command 'ls', by trying either of the following:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{ls --help}%
$ %\textbf{man ls}%
$ %\textbf{info ls}%
\end{prompt}

(You can exit the last two "manuals" by using the 'q' key.)

\section{How to get started with shell scripts}

In a shell script, you will put the commands you would normally type at your shell prompt in the same order. This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.

Scripts are basically non-compiled pieces of code: they are just text files. Since they don't contain machine code, they are executed by what is called a "parser" or an "interpreter". This is another program that understands the command in the script, and converts them to machine code. There are many kinds of scripting languages, including Perl and Python.

Another very common scripting language is shell scripting. In a shell script, you will put the commands you would normally type at your shell prompt in the same order. This will enable you to execute all those commands at any time by only issuing one command: starting the script.

Typically in the following examples they'll have on each line the next command to be executed although it is possible to put multiple commands on one line. A very simple example of a script may be:

\begin{prog}
echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"
hostname
\end{prog}

You can type both lines at your shell prompt, and the result will be the following:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
$ %\textbf{hostname}%
login1
\end{prompt}

Suppose we want to call this script "foo". You open a new file for editing, and name it "foo", and edit it with your favorite editor
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{vi foo}%
\end{prompt}

or use the following commando's:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{echo ``echo Hello! This is my hostname:" $>$ foo}%
$ %\textbf{echo hostname $>$$>$ foo }%
\end{prompt}

The easiest ways to run a script is by starting the interpreter and pass the script as parameter. In case of our script, the interpreter may either be 'sh' or 'bash' (which are the same on the cluster). So start the script:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{bash foo}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
ln01
\end{prompt}

Congratulations, you just created and started your first shell script!

A more advanced way of executing your shell scripts is by making them executable by their own, so without invoking the interpreter manually. The system can not automatically detect which interpreter you want, so you need to tell this in some way. The easiest way is by using the so called "shebang"-notation, explicitely created for this function: you put the following line on top of your shell script "\#!/path/to/your/interpreter".

You can find this path with the "which" command. In our case, since we use bash as an interpreter, we get the following path:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{which bash}%
/bin/bash
\end{prompt}

We edit our script and change it with this information:
\begin{prog}
\#!/bin/bash
echo "Hello! This is my hostname:"
hostname
\end{prog}

Note that the "shebang" must be the first line of your script! Now the operating system knows which program should be started to run the script.

Finally, we tell the operating system that this script is now executable. For this we change its file attributes:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{chmod +x foo}%
\end{prompt}

Now you can start your script by simply executing it:
\begin{prompt}
$ %\textbf{./foo}%
Hello! This is my hostname:
ln01
\end{prompt}

The same technique can be used for all other scripting languages, like Perl and Python.

Most scripting languages understand that lines beginning with "\#" are comments, and should be ignored. If the language you want to use does not ignore these lines, you may get strange results\ldots
