How do SSH keys work
-   anyone who has the key (and the optional password) can unlock the
    door and log in to the account.
-   the door to your VSC account is special: it can have multiple
    locks (SSH public keys) attached to it, and you only need to open
    one lock with the corresponding key (SSH private key) to open
    the door (log in to the account).
Since all VSC clusters use Linux as their main operating system, you
will need to get acquainted with using the command-line interface and
using the terminal (see tutorial).
