This file has been stored in the directory "~/.ssh/".
 tip
    As ".ssh" is an invisible directory, the Finder will not show it by
    default. The easiest way to access the folder, is by pressing ++cmd+shift+g++ (or ++cmd+shift+"."++),
    which will allow you to enter the name of a directory, which you would
    like to open in Finder. Here, type "~/.ssh" and press enter.
After you have uploaded your public key you will receive an e-mail with
a link to confirm your e-mail address. After confirming your e-mail
address the VSC staff will review and if applicable approve your
account.
