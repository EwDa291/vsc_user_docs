Before requesting a VSC account, you need to generate a pair of ssh
keys. You need 2 keys, a public and a private key. You can visualise the
public key as a lock to which only you have the key (your private key).
You can send a copy of your lock to anyone without any problems, because
only you can open it, as long as you keep your private key secure. To
generate a public/private key pair, you can use the PuTTYgen key
generator.
Start PuTTYgen.exe it and follow these steps:
1.  In "Parameters" (at the bottom of the window), choose "RSA" and set the number of
    bits in the key to 4096.
2.  Click on "Generate". To generate the key, you must move the mouse cursor over
    the PuTTYgen window (this generates some random data that PuTTYgen
    uses to generate the key pair). Once the key pair is generated, your
    public key is shown in the field "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file".
3.  Next, it is advised to fill in the "Key comment" field to make it easier
    identifiable afterwards.
4.  Next, you should specify a passphrase in the "Key passphrase" field and retype it in
    the "Confirm passphrase" field. Remember, the passphrase protects the private key against
    unauthorised use, so it is best to choose one that is not too easy
    to guess but that you can still remember. Using a passphrase is not
    required, but we recommend you to use a good passphrase unless you
    are certain that your computer's hard disk is encrypted with a
    decent password. (If you are not sure your disk is encrypted, it
    probably isn't.)
5.  Save both the public and private keys in a folder on your personal
    computer (We recommend to create and put them in the folder
    "C:\\Users\\%USERNAME%\\AppData\\Local\\PuTTY\\.ssh") with the
    buttons "Save public key" and "Save private key". We recommend using the name "id_rsa.pub" for the public key, and
    "id_rsa.ppk" for the private key.
