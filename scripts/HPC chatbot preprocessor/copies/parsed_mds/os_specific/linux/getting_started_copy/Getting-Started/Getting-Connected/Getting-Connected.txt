it is recommended to make use of the `ssh` command in a terminal to get the most flexibility. 

Assuming you have already generated SSH keys in the previous step (Getting Access[1]), and that they are in a default location, you should now be able to login by running the following command:

<pre><code>ssh {{userid}}@{{loginnode}}</code></pre>

!!! Warning "User your own VSC account id"
    
    Replace <b>{{userid}}</b> with your VSC account id (see <https://account.vscentrum.be>)

!!! Tip

    You can also still use the web portal (see shell access on web portal[2])
