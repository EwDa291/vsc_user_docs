In the screenshots, we show the setup for user
to the HPC cluster via the login node "login.hpc.ugent.be".
1.  Start the PuTTY executable putty.exe in your directory
    C:\Program Files (x86)\PuTTY and the configuration screen will pop
    up. As you will often use the PuTTY tool, we recommend adding a
    shortcut on your desktop.
2.  Within the category <Session\>, in the field <Host Name\>, enter the name of the
    login node of the cluster (i.e., "login.hpc.ugent.be") you want to connect to.
    
3.  In the category "Connection > Data", in the field "Auto-login username", put in <vsc40000\> , which is your VSC
    username that you have received by e-mail after your request was
    approved.
