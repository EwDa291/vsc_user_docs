To get access to the HPC-UGent infrastructure, visit Getting an HPC Account[1].

If you have not used Linux before, 
now would be a good time to follow our Linux Tutorial[2].

#### A typical workflow looks like this:

1.  Connect to the login nodes 
2.  Transfer your files to the HPC-UGent infrastructure
3.  Optional: compile your code and test it 
4.  Create a job script and submit your job
5.  Wait for job to be executed
6.  Study the results generated by your jobs, either on the cluster or
    after downloading them locally.

We will walk through an illustrative workload to get you started. In this example, our objective is to train a deep learning model for recognizing hand-written digits (MNIST dataset) using TensorFlow[3];
see the example scripts[4].
