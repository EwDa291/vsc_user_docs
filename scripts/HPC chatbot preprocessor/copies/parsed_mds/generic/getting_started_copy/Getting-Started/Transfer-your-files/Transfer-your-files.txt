Now that you can login, it is time to transfer files from your local computer to your **home directory** on the HPC-UGent infrastructure.

Download tensorflow_mnist.py[1] 
and run.sh[2] example scripts to your computer (from here[3]).


When running `ls` in your session on the HPC-UGent infrastructure, you should see the two files listed in your home directory (`~`):

```shell
$ ls ~
run.sh tensorflow_mnist.py
```

When you do not see these files, make sure you uploaded the files to your **home directory**.
