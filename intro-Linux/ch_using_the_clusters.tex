\chapter{Using the clusters}

The use the clusters beyond the \gls{login-node}(s) which have limited resources, you
should create job scripts and submit them to the clusters.

The basic commands are:

\begin{enumerate}
 \item``qsub <script>'': submit a job script
 \item``qstat'': check on queued/running jobs
 \item``qdel'': delete a queued/running job
 \item``module swap cluster/<name>'': prepare environment for quering/submitting to a particular cluster
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercises}

Create and submit a job script that computes the sum of 1-100 using Python, and
prints the numbers to a \emph{unique} output file in \lstinline|$VSC_SCRATCH|.

Hint: \lstinline|python -c "print(sum(range(1, 101)))"|
