# Torque frontend via jobcli

## What is Torque

[Torque](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE) is a resource manager for submitting and managing jobs on an HPC cluster. It is an implementation of [PBS (Portable Batch System)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portable_Batch_System).
Torque is not widely used anymore, so the {{hpcinfra}} no longer uses Torque in the backend since 2021 in favor of Slurm.
The Torque user interface, which consists of commands like `qsub` and `qstat`, were kept however, to avoid that researchers had to learn other commands to submit and manage jobs.

## Slurm backend

Just like Torque, [Slurm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slurm_Workload_Manager) is a resource manager for submitting and managing jobs on an HPC cluster. Currently, Slurm is the most popular workload manager on HPC systems worldwide, however it makes use of different commands that are less intuitive and user friendly than Torque/PBS.

## jobcli

Jobcli was developed to make it possible for the {{hpcinfra}} to use a Torque frontend and a Slurm backend. In addition to that, it adds some additional options for Torque commands.

### help option

Adding `--help` to a Torque command when using it on the {{hpcinfra}} will output a manual for that command, including all possible options for that command (including the original ones from Torque and the ones added by jobcli) and an explanation for each one.

### dryrun option

Adding `--dryrun` to a Torque command when using it on the {{hpcinfra}} will show the user what Slurm commands are generated by that Torque command by jobcli. Using `--dryrun` will not actually submit the job.

See [the examples](./#examples)

### debug option

Similarly to `--dryrun`, adding `--debug` to a Torque command when using it on the {{hpcinfra}} will show the user what Slurm commands are generated by that Torque command by jobcli. However in contrast to `--dryrun`, using `--debug` will actually submit the job afterwards.

See [the examples](./#examples)

### Examples

The following examples illustrate the working of the `--dryrun` and `--debug` options with and example jobscript.

`example.sh`:

```shell
#/bin/bash
#PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
#PBS -l walltime=2:30:00

module load SciPy-bundle/...

python script.py > script.out.${PBS_JOBID}
```

#### Example of the dryrun option

Running the following command:

```shell
$ qsub --dryrun example.sh -N example
```

will generate this output:

```shell

Command that would have been run:
---------------------------------

/usr/bin/sbatch

Job script that would have been submitted:
------------------------------------------

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --chdir="/user/gent/464/vsc46416"
#SBATCH --error="/kyukon/home/gent/464/vsc46416/examples/%x.e%A"
#SBATCH --export="NONE"
#SBATCH --get-user-env="60L"
#SBATCH --job-name="example"
#SBATCH --mail-type="NONE"
#SBATCH --nodes="1"
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node="8"
#SBATCH --ntasks="8"
#SBATCH --output="/kyukon/home/gent/464/vsc46416/examples/%x.o%A"
#SBATCH --time="02:30:00"

### (start of lines that were added automatically by jobcli)
#
# original submission command:
# qsub --dryrun example.sh -N example
#
# directory where submission command was executed:
# /kyukon/home/gent/464/vsc46416/examples
#
# original script header:
# #PBS -l nodes=1:ppn=8
# #PBS -l walltime=2:30:00
#
### (end of lines that were added automatically by jobcli)

#/bin/bash

module load SciPy-bundle/2023.11-gfbf-2023b

python script.py > script.out.${PBS_JOBID}
```
This output consist of a few components. For our example the most important lines are the ones that start with `$SBATCH` since these contain the translation of the Torque commands to Slurm commands. For example the job-name is the one we specified with the `-N` option in the command.

#### Example of the debug option

Similarly to the `--dryrun` example, we start by running the following command:

```shell
$ qsub --debug example.sh -N example
```

which generates this output:

```shell
DEBUG: Submitting job script location at example.sh
DEBUG: Generated script header
#SBATCH --chdir="/user/gent/464/vsc46416"
#SBATCH --error="/kyukon/home/gent/464/vsc46416/examples/%x.e%A"
#SBATCH --export="NONE"
#SBATCH --get-user-env="60L"
#SBATCH --job-name="example"
#SBATCH --mail-type="NONE"
#SBATCH --nodes="1"
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node="8"
#SBATCH --ntasks="8"
#SBATCH --output="/kyukon/home/gent/464/vsc46416/examples/%x.o%A"
#SBATCH --time="02:30:00"
DEBUG: HOOKS: Looking for hooks in directory '/etc/jobcli/hooks'
DEBUG: HOOKS: Directory '/etc/jobcli/hooks' does not exist, so no hooks there
DEBUG: Running command '/usr/bin/sbatch'
64842138
```
The output once again consists of the translated Slurm commands with some additional debug information and a job id for the job that was submitted.
