\chapter{HPC-UGent debug cluster}
\label{ch:debug_ugent}


\section{Purpose}
\label{sec:debug_ugent_pupose}
The purpose of the debug cluster is to run debug jobs. Additionally, it can be also used for courses. 
The debug cluster is overcommited, which means that 6 times more CPU core can be
scheduled than physically exist in the cluster. The cluster performance heavily depends on the
workload, and running jobs can slow down or speed up during they are running.  In the case of a
fully loaded cluster, jobs would run about 6 times slower compared to an empty cluster. 
\\ Due to the restrictions (see section~\ref{subsec:debug_ugent_restrictions}) and sharing the CPU
resorces, jobs on this cluster should normally immediately start. As a consequence,
typical workload for this cluster are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item  Debugging programs
  \item  Try/debug submit scripts
  \item  Run small jobs when performance is not an issue (courses, hands-ons, etc.)
  \item  Run interactive jobs (see chapter~\ref{ch:running-interactive-jobs}) with lots of idle time
         (courses, hads-ons, etc.) 
  \item  Run Cluster Desktops (see chapter~\ref{ch:web_portal}) whith lots of idle time
         (courses, hands-ons, etc.)
\end{itemize} 

\section{Submitting jobs}
\label{sec:debug_ugent_jobs}

To submit jobs to the HPC-UGent debug cluster nicknamed \lstinline|slaking|, first use:

\begin{prompt}
%\shellcmd{module swap cluster/slaking}
\end{prompt}

Then use the familiar \lstinline|qsub|, \lstinline|qstat|, etc. commands.

\subsection{Restrictions}
\label{subsec:debug_ugent_restrictions}

Currently one user can have maximum 5 jobs in the queue (running and waiting for run), and 
maximum 3 jobs per user can run at the same time. The running jobs can allocate maximum 8
CPU cores. \\ Please note that based on the (historical) workload of the debug cluster,
the above restrictions and the overcommitment ratio might change without prior notice.
